I wanted to make some quick code to train my Vex Robotics Drive Team how to score matches in real time to help with driver strategy.
The code basically has you download images of various field setups with differing scores.
Once you do this you should run reaction_test.py and click rename images, this will name each image in the images folder correctly.
Then you should click build labels and score each match there so that you have what you should compare against. 
Then just have your driveteam run the reaction test and measure how long it takes to score. 
Run the visualizer to generate some data
